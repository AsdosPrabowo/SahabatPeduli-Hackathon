Welcome to `SahabatPeduli`, an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the distribution of social assistance funds in Indonesia. The project is built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) as a `Fully-Onchain SocialFi application`, utilizing blockchain technology to bring transparency, accountability and efficiency to the process.

## About SahabatPeduli

In Indonesia, the distribution of social support funds faces several critical challenges, including a lack of transparency, rampant corruption, unequal distribution, and minimal accountability. 

These issues have led to a loss of public trust and have hindered efforts to ensure that the funds reach those most in need.

To address this challenge, we created `SahabatPeduli` or `a Caring Friend` in English, a cutting-edge web platform that operates entirely on top of the ICP blockchain. With `SahabatPeduli`, users can monitor the movement of social assistance funds in real-time, tracking every transaction from the central government to the final recipient. The platform ensures that every transaction is transparently recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered, allowing the public to securely track the distribution process and restore trust in the social support system.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track the movement of social assistance funds from allocation to distribution in real-time.
- **Immutable Ledger:** Every transaction is securely recorded on the ICP blockchain, ensuring that the data is tamper-proof.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The platform is easily accessible and works across all devices, providing a seamless user experience.

### Technical Overview

From a technical standpoint, `SahabatPeduli` utilizes some of the most powerful tools and frameworks available:

- **Juno Framework:** The platform is built using the Juno framework, which allows us to create a non-SQL database for efficient data tracking. Juno's powerful features enable the management of various services such as data storage, making it an ideal choice for creating a decentralized application on the blockchain.
- **Motoko Backend:** The backend services are powered by Motoko, which is fully supported by ICP, providing robust and scalable solutions. With Motoko, we manage various actions efficiently, ensuring that the platform remains responsive and secure.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** The client side is developed with React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface, while the server side is managed by Motoko within the Juno framework. This combination ensures that `SahabatPeduli` is not only powerful but also user-friendly and accessible to all.

`SahabatPeduli` isn’t just a concept; it's a real-world solution. By leveraging the power of the Internet Computer, we’ve built a platform that is functional, secure, and has the potential to significantly improve lives across Indonesia. The use of ICP's ledger allows for direct transactions, further enhancing the efficiency and transparency of the system.

### X Factor and Potential

The wow factor of "SahabatPeduli" lies in its innovative use of blockchain technology, specifically ICP, to address critical issues in social aid distribution. The platform's potential is immense as it not only enhances transparency and accountability but also restores public trust in government social assistance programs. By providing real-time tracking, immutable blockchain records for transactions, and easy accessibility, it offers a groundbreaking solution that can be scaled to other regions and contexts.

### Technical Competence

We use the Juno framework to help us build a blockchain dApp and also use Motoko as a backend service to support various services within our platform. Juno is powerful for handling multiple services like data storage, helping us create a non-SQL database for tracking data. Combined with Motoko, Juno becomes even more powerful, providing full support for ICP. `SahabatPeduli` uses a client-server schema, with the client using React and the backend using Motoko within the Juno framework, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

### Impact

"SahabatPeduli" directly addresses significant real-world issues such as lack of transparency and corruption, unequal distribution of funds, and lack of accountability in Indonesia. It provides a practical solution that is immediately usable by both the government and the public. The platform's user-friendly interface ensures that people of all backgrounds can access and benefit from the service, making it a valuable tool in the fight against social inequity.

### Progression

Yes, we effectively utilized libraries and services in the development of `SahabatPeduli`. By incorporating existing libraries, we streamlined the integration of core functionalities, such as cryptographic operations and user authentication via Internet Identity, into our dApp. The service is fully functional and deployed on the Internet Computer mainnet, making it accessible and usable by end-users for transparent management of social product funds. We went as far as deploying a fully operational, on-chain application that demonstrates the practical viability of ICP technology in addressing real-world challenges, ensuring a high level of usability and security throughout the process.

### IC Superpowers

We utilized ICP's superpowers effectively by leveraging ledgers to facilitate payments and receipts in ICP tokens, employing canisters for managing various actions, using Motoko to handle these actions, and using Juno to optimize data utilization. These elements combined make `SahabatPeduli` a powerful and efficient platform that leverages the full potential of the Internet Computer.

## Getting Started

To start exploring and developing with `SahabatPeduli`, you can navigate through the project directory structure and familiarize yourself with the configuration files. Below are some steps and commands to help you get started:

### Project Setup

To begin, explore the project directory and familiarize yourself with the structure. Working within this environment will not impact any production deployments or identity tokens.

For more information and detailed guidance, refer to the following resources:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

### Running the Project Locally

If you want to test `SahabatPeduli` locally, use the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd SahabatPeduli/

# Start the local ICP replica in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploy canisters to the replica and generate your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

### What we have learned

During the preparation of hacktahon and especially the 2 days of work, we learned that icp is a movement that will be a very big thing later, we learned many things from what is a canister, how to make it, how to architect it, learning how to create a fully onchain app using motoko.

### Challenges we faced

We experienced many technical issues, ranging from canister issues, deploy mainnet, to ladger issues. Fortunately, the mentors from icp helped very well and full of effort even made mr gabor himself create an issue in our repository which you can see here: https://github.com/AsdosPrabowo/SahabatPeduli-Hackathon/issues

### The things we're proud of

This is our first blockchain project, we didn't even really understand web3 before this and we managed to create this simple project in less than 2 days. We are very proud of the progress we went through, the stark difference from a lot of errors until we were able to solve it with the help of our mentors.
